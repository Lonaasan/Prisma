# General Concept

## What do we want to archieve with Prisma?

- Communication bridge / library between modules (& mods if possible?) using the `string` / `math` table
- Try to save data over warps with the `storage` table
- Being able to recover the last state of a mod before uninit for special demands, for example:
    - Having a log of where the player was and being able to go / warp back in history
    - Being able to keep the settings for lua mods and not needing to set them again
