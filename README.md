Discover the possibilities of StarLoader!

experimental / early access release

Do you love playing Starbound with mods? Do you want to create your own modules or customize existing ones? Do you wish you had more control over your modded game?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you need StarLoader!

StarLoader is a mod for Starbound that lets you:

- Easily install and manage/load other mods (called modules) from other starloader modules on steam or make your own modules!
- Develop your own modules using StarLoaderâ€™s Functions and Framework
- Access a GUI called StarHub where you can browse, enable and disable modules with a click
- Enjoy no interference with most Starbound mods and vanilla gameplay

Explore the possibilities of StarLoader with its open source code and Discord community!

StarLoader has three main components:

- [x] StarLoader Core: runs the API and provides core functions like emulating techs and accessing lua tables
- [x] StarLoader API: offers version-independent functions for modules
- [x] StarLoader Framework: contains utility files that form the base for Core and API


Some of the features that are planned to be included in StarLoader are:

- [ ] Shield: protects your game from unwanted interactions from blacklisted players
- [ ] Animation: allows you to create custom animations for your items and avatars
- [x] Remote: lets you control your game from another device or let another player control yours (with your permission)
- [ ] Debug: helps you debug your modules and fix errors
- [ ] Editor: enables you to edit your items and avatars in-game


StarLoader also has some advanced features that require unsafe functions or Hasibound:

- [ ] Avatar Swap: lets you change your avatar appearance on the fly
- [ ] Shared Inventory: lets you share items between different avatars


StarLoader is completely written in Lua and multiplayer compatible. It is a mod that transforms your Starbound experience by giving you more control over your mods.
